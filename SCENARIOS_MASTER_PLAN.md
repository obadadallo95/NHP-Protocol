- **9D. Sub-Saharan Africa** — Nigeria (220M), Kenya (50M) — M-Pesa dominant, Tecno/Infinix phones, low electricity reliability
- **9E. Latin America** — Brazil (215M), Mexico (130M) — Pix (Brazil's UPI), MercadoPago, high smartphone penetration
- **9F. Europe** — Germany, France, UK — GDPR strict, high income (NHP less attractive as income), but Green Tech angle
- **Est. scenarios:** ~60 | **Est. charts:** 8

### Phase 10 — AI Task Decomposition
> Which AI tasks can ACTUALLY run on phones? Quality comparison with cloud.

- **10A. Inference Tasks** — Image classification, object detection, NLP, sentiment analysis, OCR — quality vs cloud
- **10B. Generation Tasks** — Image generation (SD-Lite), text gen (Llama 3B), audio TTS — feasibility per phone tier
- **10C. Training Tasks** — Federated learning, fine-tuning LoRA adapters, gradient computation — is it possible?
- **10D. Data Processing** — Batch ETL, log analysis, data labeling, annotation — ideal for phones
- **10E. Task Splitting** — How to decompose 1 large task into 1000 phone-sized micro-tasks
- **10F. Quality Benchmarks** — NHP output quality vs AWS/GCP for each task type (accuracy, latency, reliability)
- **Est. scenarios:** ~50 | **Est. charts:** 8

### Phase 11 — User Psychology & Adoption
> Why would someone enable NHP? What drives trust? How to reach mass adoption?

- **11A. Trust Factors** — What makes users comfortable sharing their phone's compute? Survey-based modeling
- **11B. Opt-in vs Pre-installed** — Conversion rates comparison (1% opt-in vs 30% pre-installed default-on)
- **11C. Gamification** — Leaderboards, streaks, badges, social sharing — impact on retention
- **11D. Referral Economics** — "Invite a friend, both earn double for 1 month" — viral coefficient modeling
- **11E. Churn Prediction** — Why users stop? Battery anxiety, low earnings, phone upgrade — retention strategies
- **11F. Demographics** — Age, income, tech literacy, region — who adopts first?
- **Est. scenarios:** ~40 | **Est. charts:** 6

### Phase 12 — Manufacturer Integration Paths
> Technical roadmap for each manufacturer's OS/TEE/NPU integration.

- **12A. Samsung Knox Integration** — Knox Container API, Samsung Blockchain Keystore, One UI Services

- **12C. OPPO/Vivo ColorOS/Funtouch** — BBK Group synergy, shared TEE infrastructure
- **12D. Huawei HarmonyOS NEXT** — HiAI Engine, TrustZone, AppGallery distribution
- **12E. Revenue Share Models** — 70/15/15 (user/platform/manufacturer) vs 85/10/5 — what's optimal?
- **12F. Pre-installed vs Store** — APK sideload vs Play Store vs manufacturer store
- **Est. scenarios:** ~35 | **Est. charts:** 6

### Phase 13 — Revenue & Business Model
> Complete financial projections for investors and Jobcenter.

- **13C. B2B vs B2C** — Selling compute to enterprises vs individual developers
- **13D. Pricing Strategy** — Dynamic pricing (supply/demand), subscription tiers, enterprise SLA
- **13E. Funding Requirements** — Pre-seed → Seed → Series A milestones and $ needed
- **13F. Competitive Moat** — Network effects, manufacturer lock-in, data moat, patent strategy
- **Est. scenarios:** ~45 | **Est. charts:** 8

### Phase 14 — Technical Architecture
> How NHP actually works under the hood.

- **14A. Task Routing** — Shortest path, load balancing, geographic proximity, device capability matching
- **14B. Data Flow** — Developer SDK → API Gateway → Task Queue → Device Selection → Execution → Verification → Result
- **14C. SDK Design** — What the developer API looks like (Python/Node.js SDK, REST API, GraphQL)
- **14D. Latency Modeling** — End-to-end latency per task type, per region, per device class
- **14E. Bandwidth Consumption** — How much data per task? WiFi-only constraint. Fair usage
