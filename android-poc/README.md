## What This Proves

1. **Condition detection works** — the app reads real device state (charging, WiFi, screen) using native Android APIs
2. **Background persistence works** — ForegroundService keeps running when screen is off
3. **The UX concept works** — users see earnings accumulate passively without any interaction

## What This Does NOT Prove (Yet)

- Real NPU/TEE integration (requires manufacturer API access)
- Real AI task execution (currently simulated)
- Real payment settlement (currently simulated)

These are Phase 3–4 goals requiring manufacturer partnership and funding.
