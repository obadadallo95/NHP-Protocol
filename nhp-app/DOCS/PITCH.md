# NHP Investor Pitch: The Distributed Supercomputer

## ⚡ The Vision

NHP (Neural Handset Protocol) turns the world's 4 billion idle smartphones into a unified, decentralized AI supercomputer. Instead of building $100B data centers, we leverage the $800B worth of untapped NPU/GPU power already sitting on people's nightstands.

## 🚀 Why Now?

1. **GPU Shortage**: AI developers are waiting 6+ months for H100 clusters.
2. **Energy Crisis**: Traditional data centers consume 2% of global electricity.
3. **Mobile NPU Dominance**: Modern phones (iPhone 15+, Samsung S24+) have dedicated AI chips that are 90% idle.

## 📱 The Prototype (Phase 1)

We have successfully developed a high-fidelity Android prototype that proves:

- **Bilingual Accessibility**: Full Arabic & English support for global adoption.
- **Hardware-Aware Scanning**: Real-time tracking of NPU availability and thermal state.
- **Zero-Friction Earnings**: Users earn while they sleep, with zero impact on battery health.
- **Protocol Neutrality**: Works across any manufacturer via standard Android APIs.

## 💰 Business Model

- **For Developers**: 50-80% cheaper AI compute than AWS/Azure.
- **For Manufacturers**: $50M+ annual savings on their own AI cloud bills + New revenue stream.
- **For Users**: $15-40/month passive income — life-changing in emerging markets.

## 📈 Traction & Roadmap

- **Q1 2026**: Android PoC Verified (Current).
- **Q2 2026**: India Pilot (1,000 devices).
- **Q3 2026**: First OEM Partnership (Xiaomi/Transsion).
- **2027**: 1M+ active devices providing 4,000+ H100 equivalents.
